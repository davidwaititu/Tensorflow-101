# TensorFlow Keras Classification Tutorial

This repository contains code based on the official [TensorFlow Keras classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification). The tutorial demonstrates how to train a simple neural network model to classify images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The project demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Building a neural network model using Keras (a high-level API for TensorFlow)
- Compiling the model with loss, optimizer, and metrics
- Training and evaluating the model
- Making predictions on new data

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
